I provide a live one man show that's unlike any solo act you've seen in town.
Basically, my show is a 100% live-looped, nonstop, improvised instrumental jam session.  You'll see me play guitar, bass, keys, bongos, congos, and it's all
me, live looped, and made in real time!  I may have some ambient nature sounds
playing in the background from time to time, but it's a very relaxing, live 
jam kind of vibe.`;
