export const text1 = `Thanks for visiting my site! I am a solo musician based in sunny
Jacksonville, FL. I provide 100% live-looped instrumental jams!
The music I play is mostly improvised and the sounds can range
from funky to wonky, relaxing yet wavey, bluesy to twangy, to
all around trippy and spacey. Its basically chill elevator music
with a tropical space vibe. I have spent the last 15 years
perfecting the art of making people melt on the couch. Thanks
for visiting my site!`;

export const text2 = ` I provide an entertaining and musically engaging show. At the same time, TFT is more of an ambience than it is a traditional musical performance. All I want to do is jam out at a comfortable audio level
while you and your friends can still have conversations with
one another without yelling over the music. So get ready to be jammed, kick back, and watch me play with my Toys From Taiwan!`;
